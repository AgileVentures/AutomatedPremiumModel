This is an in-progress prototype for automating the running of the current ML prediction for premium signup

You will need to install the packages httr, httptest, anytime and jsonlite, i.e.
install.packages("httr")
install.packages("httptest")
install.packages("jsonlite")
install.packages("anytime")

To run the existing tests then do:

RScript run_tests.R

You should get something like this output:

Loading required package: testthat
Loading required package: methods
testing utilities: ............

DONE ===========================================================================

You can run the code in basic_functionality_so_far.R in something like Rstudio and examine the results in the variable results to see what can be gleaned so far from the history of the #general
channel, however you will need to insert a valid token into test_token, ie modify this line

test_token <- "insert token here"

where you replace "insert token here" with a real valid token that will work on our slack #general channel


So far, and to do:

done - Code that can fetch a channel's history between dates


To do:
 Make the code that fetches a channel's history robust to errors like rate limiting, internet weather, etc
 Make code to Fetch a list of all relevant channels to mine for history
 Make code to Fetch all relevant channels' history -- and build a running dataframe of such history
 Make code to calculate the relevant features from the dataframe of history, ie, a user's aggregate "posts" during week 1, week 2, and week 3, and build a dataframe of it
 Make code to fetch a list of all users
 Make code to cross link the list of all users data, ie emai land username, with the dataframe of relevant features from history (week1, week2, week3)

 Run feature dataframe through ML model, ie adaboost, etc and get results
 Make code to send message to @tansaku on slack about week's results (ie, using slackr), and some results to #data-mining (ie, with no emails)
